==================

Arduino LED Chaser with Buttons

Demo Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIHpoEE0R98

This circuit has 6 LEDs and 3 buttons, the LEDs are arranged in a circle

The LEDs are connected to PWM outputs and their brightness is continuously adjusted on a sine wave pattern
The brightness of each led is 60 degrees out of phase with the next
This gives the impression of LED brightness rotating around the circle

Button 1 increases the speed of rotation
Button 2 decreases the speed of rotation
Button 3 reverses the speed of rotation
